# Laptop Price Prediction with Random Forest

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting laptop prices based on their specifications using the Random Forest algorithm. The model is implemented in Python using the scikit-learn library and trained on a dataset comprising various laptop features such as processor speed, RAM size, storage capacity, and display resolution.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the dataset used for training the model.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts for model implementation, training, and prediction.
- **`README.md`**: Provides an overview of the project, its structure, and instructions for usage.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/laptop-price-prediction.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd laptop-price-prediction
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Place your dataset in the `data/` directory.
   - Ensure the dataset is in a compatible format (e.g., CSV, Excel) and contains relevant laptop features and their corresponding prices.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Explore the dataset using Jupyter notebooks located in the `notebooks/` directory.
   - Perform data visualization, statistical analysis, and feature engineering to gain insights into the data.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Train the Random Forest model using the provided scripts or notebooks.
   - Tune hyperparameters and evaluate model performance using cross-validation techniques.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Once the model is trained, use it to predict laptop prices based on new input data.
   - Modify the input features in the provided script or notebook for prediction.
